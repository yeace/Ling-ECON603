  abstract = {We construct a database of public pension policy changes with motivation and implementation information for ten OECD countries. Structural pension reforms, motivated by long-run sustainability concerns, often come with prolonged phase-in periods. In response to pension retrenchments implemented immediately, people close to retirement stay in the workforce longer. News about future pension retrenchments with implementation lags, however, is likely to lead this group to exit the labor market. This decline in the labor force participation rate is particularly strong for reforms with long lags, ones that introduce fundamental policy changes, and ones where citizens have lower trust in the government.

  abstract = {Feng, Jin, He, Lixin, and Sato, Hiroshi---Public pension and household saving: Evidence from urban China We relate household savings to pension reform, to explain the high household savings rates in urban China from a new perspective. We use the exogenous -- policy-induced -- variation in pension wealth to estimate explicitly the impact of pension wealth on household savings, and obtain evidence of a significant offset effect of pension wealth on household savings. Although the size of the effect depends on the parameter values assumed, the finding that household savings are affected by pension reform is robust. Our estimates show that, under plausible scenarios, pension reform boosted household savings rates in 1999 by about 6--9 percentage points for cohorts aged 25--29 and by about 2--3 percentage points for cohorts aged 50--59. Our results also indicate that declining pension wealth reduces expenditure on education and health more than on other consumption items. Journal of Comparative Economics 39 (4) (2011) 470--485.

  abstract = {Using national longitudinal survey data, we study how the Chinese New Rural Pension Scheme (NRPS) reform affects the rural labour supply structure of individuals aged 20--70. Applying multiple regression approaches, we find NRPS does not significantly affect Chinese rural residents' weekly working hours, labour force participation, or migration choices; only those aged 50--59 change their labour supply pattern after joining the pension system. Parental pensions motivate adult children to migrate out only when both parents receive pensions. Various factors are explored to understand our findings; the low subsidy that Chinese rural pensioners currently receive is the major factor. These results indicate that from the perspective of improving the welfare of the rural elderly and encouraging the more free flow of young rural labour force, it is necessary to increase the compensation level of NRPS.},

  abstract = {Capital income inequality is large and growing fast, accounting for a significant portion of total income inequality. We study its growth in a general equilibrium portfolio choice model with endogenous information acquisition and heterogeneity across household sophistication and asset riskiness. The model implies capital income inequality that grows with aggregate information technology. Investors di↵erentially adjust both the size and composition of their portfolios, as unsophisticated investors retrench from trading risky securities and shift their portfolios toward safer assets. Technological progress also reduces aggregate returns and increases the volume of transactions, features that are consistent with recent U.S. data.},
