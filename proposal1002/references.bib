  abstract = {We use data on stock portfolios of Norwegian households to show that stock market wealth increases entrepreneurship by relaxing financial constraints. Our research design isolates idiosyncratic variation in household-level stock market returns. An increase in stock market wealth increases the propensity to start a firm, with the response concentrated in households with moderate levels of financial wealth, for whom a 20 percent increase in wealth due to a positive stock return increases the likelihood to start a firm by about 20\%, and in years when the aggregate stock market return in Norway is high. We develop a method to study the effect of wealth on firm outcomes that corrects for the bias introduced by selection into entrepreneurship. Higher wealth causally increases firm profitability, an indication that it relaxes would-be entrepreneurs' financial constraints. Consistent with this interpretation, the pass-through from stock wealth into equity in the new firm is one-for-one.},

  abstract = {The U.S. entrepreneurial finance market has changed dramatically over the last two decades. Entrepreneurs raising their first round of venture capital retain 30\% more equity in their firm and are more likely to control their board of directors. Late-stage startups are raising larger amounts of capital in the private markets from a growing pool of traditional and new investors. These private market changes have coincided with a sharp decline in the number of firms going public ---and when firms do go public, they are older and have raised more private capital. To understand these facts, we provide a systematic description of the differences between private and public firms. Next, we review several regulatory, technological, and competitive changes affecting both startups and investors that help explain how the trade-offs between going public and staying private have changed. We conclude by listing several open research questions.},

  abstract = {Enacted March 27, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the most ambitious and creative fiscal policy response to the Pandemic Recession in the United States. PPP offers forgivable loans --- essentially grants --- to businesses with 500 or fewer employees that meet certain requirements. In this paper, we present evidence that PPP has substantially increased the employment, financial health, and survival of small businesses, using data from the Dun \& Bradstreet Corporation. We use event studies and standard difference-in-difference models to estimate the effect of a small business applying for larger PPP loans and of a small business being eligible for PPP based on size. While our findings are informative, we believe it is too early to issue conclusive judgment on PPP's success. We offer lessons for the future from the PPP experience thus far.},

  abstract = {I document a significant decline in the share of entrepreneurs among US households over the last three decades. Most of this decline is accounted for by a drop in the share of entrepreneurs among college graduates. Using a standard entrepreneurial choice model with two skill groups---high- and low-skill individuals---I then argue that the decline is the outcome of two technological forces that increased the returns to high-skill labor: the skill-biased technical change and the decrease in the price of capital. I find that these two forces account for three-quarters of the decline in the share of entrepreneurs.},

  abstract = {Entrepreneurship in the United States has declined in recent decades. Using household survey data, I show that this decline is driven by the falling share of unincorporated selfemployment (i.e., sole proprietorships and partnerships), while the share of incorporated self-employment (i.e., S and C corporations) has risen. This pattern is robust across demographic characteristics and data sources. To understand these trends, I build a generalequilibrium heterogeneous-agent model with occupational choices and two types of selfemployment. To investigate the source of the aggregate trends in entrepreneurship, I conduct counterfactual experiments. I evaluate two potential factors observed in the data over the same period: (i) an investment-specific technological change and (ii) a decline in tax progressivity. The results show that the main driver of declining entrepreneurship is technological change, whereas the decline in tax progressivity played a minor role.},
